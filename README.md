## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Bhanu Prakash Achini, a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science student specializing in **Data Science** at Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology. With hands-on experience in **MERN stack development**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, I enjoy solving real-world problems through innovative tech solutions.

During my recent **💻 Web Development internship**, I built scalable full-stack applications using **⚛️ React**, **🔗 Node.js**, and **🗃️ MongoDB**, and also contributed to API development and UI design.

My academic projects reflect my passion for **AI 🤖 and ML 📊** – from building an **🔐 Intrusion Detection System** to developing a **🫁 Lung Disease Detection** model using **deep learning** and **Flask/Streamlit**. I’m a quick learner, team collaborator, and constantly striving to improve my skills.

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a **developer 💼** and **data scientist 🔬**.
