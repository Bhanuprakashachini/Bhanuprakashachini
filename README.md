## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Bhanu Prakash Achini, a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science student specializing in **Data Science** at Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology. With hands-on experience in **MERN stack development**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, I enjoy solving real-world problems through innovative tech solutions.

During my recent **Web Development internship**, I built scalable full-stack applications using **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, and also contributed to API development and UI design.

My academic projects reflect my passion for AI and ML – from building an **Intrusion Detection System** to developing a **Lung Disease Detection** model using **deep learning** and **Flask/Streamlit**. I’m a quick learner, team collaborator, and constantly striving to improve my skills.

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer and data scientist.
